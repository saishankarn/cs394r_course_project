## Abstract

In this project, we aim to tackle the problem of cruise control in the presence of noisy local sensory-control information and delayed perfect sensory-control information from the cloud. We propose a reinforcement learning based solution that effectively combines the real-time but noisy local information and accurate but delayed cloud information to perform the cruise control task. Additionally, we have provided qualitative and quantitative results validat-
ing the effectiveness of our proposed solution. Link for the video presentation:https://youtu.be/kCg-QeSLrrU
